# B3D Picture Frame Starter Add-on
_A B3D learning project to create a simple picture frame starter add-on._

Wanted to create a simple Blender 3D add-on as both a personal challenge and
ultimately to display my traditional media paintings in a virtual environment
eventually.

The add-on is launched via the Operator Search Pop-up Menu and will create
a simple and configurable 8-unit x 10-unit (inner dimensions) four-bar picture 
frame with two-unit width frame bars and one unit in depth. Afterward, the
edges can be beveled or contours created with additional loop cuts to gussy up
the frame a bit if desired.

The add-on requires "Developer Extras" to be enabled in Blender Preferences ->
Display.

Hope to add additional features at some indefinite point in the future, but for
now just getting it to work was enough :)
